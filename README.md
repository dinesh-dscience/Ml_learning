# Machine Learning Journey

This repo outlines different projects throughout my journey learning about ML models 

### 📈 Linear Regression

- The first step was using linear regression to predict student grades using `sklearn`
- Using `pickle`, we can save the model with the highest accuracy
- Finally, using `matplotlib`, we can visualize the model

### 🙍💁‍♂️ K Nearest Neighbor

- Preprocessing irregular data into numerical data
